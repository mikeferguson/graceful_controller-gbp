  * fix stutter when robot velocity exceeds max_vel_x (#69 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/69>)
    a bit of noise on the odometry can cause the robot to overshoot
    the max_vel_x - this would then cause us to decelerate - possibly
    quite hard if the decel_lim_x was high.

  * follow acceleration limits when velocity limit changes (#62 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/62>)
  * add angular velocity limiting control (#61 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/61>)
    Adds max_x_to_max_theta_scale_factor which can be used to control how the angular velocity changes relative to the linear velocity when use_vel_topic feature is enabled.

  * always rotate to match desired heading (#54 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/54>)
    If the goal tolerances are large (greater than 0.5m) the
    robot might end up trying to point at the goal rather than
    aligning with the goal heading

ros-noetic-graceful-controller-ros (0.4.3-1focal) focal; urgency=high

  * use separate decel_lim_x for control law (#45 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/45>)
  * add velocity limit to goal tolerance (#44 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/44>)
  * fix deceleration time (#43 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/43>)
    this reverts #6 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/6>, to what is apparently the correct math
  * add footprint inflation for higher speeds (#32 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/32>)
    * add a feature to inflate the footprint at higher speeds
    * only update max_vel_x once per call
  * initialze collision_points_ to null (#35 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/35>)
  * add optional visualization of colliding points (#34 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/34>)
  * split out hpp file, clang format (#33 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/33>)
  * fix bug in latch_xy_goal_tolerance (#31 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/31>)
    While the main control loop can latch the goal (thus it will stop trying to hunt around) - that isn't understood by the isGoalReached() function - which leads to the robot wiggling back and forth for a while

ros-noetic-graceful-controller-ros (0.4.1-1focal) focal; urgency=high

  * add ability to disable orientation filtering (#26 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/26>)
    also make everything dynamic reconfigurable
  * don't crash when path is empty (#25 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/25>)
  * add min_lookahead parameter (#24 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/24>)
    when the pose is very close to the robot, we can get
    some instability (rapid side-to-side movement due to
    large angular errors over small linear distances). by
    adding this parameter, we can instead fallback to
    recovery behaviors and find a better path.
  * fix occasional boost::lock crash (#23 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/23>)
  * limit the distance between poses as filter runs (#21 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/21>)
  * improve the orientation filter, add tests (#20 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/20>)

ros-noetic-graceful-controller-ros (0.4.0-1focal) focal; urgency=high

  * add usage documentation (#19 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/19>)
    also remove unused min_vel_theta parameter
  * implement changes from review (#18 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/18>)
    * Add collision checking during final rotation
    * Add comments about getRobotVel returning velocities
    * Rename path to simulated_path for clarity
    * Rename pose to target_pose and goal_pose (now separate variables)
    * Get rid of magic number for when to use final rotation
  * simulate intial rotation properly (#17 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/17>)
    previously, this simulated the big arc that we wouldn't follow anyways.
    this could cause the robot to get stuck in corners or other tight areas.

ros-noetic-graceful-controller-ros (0.3.1-1focal) focal; urgency=high

  * add feature for final rotation (#15 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/15>)
    if the final pose orientation is very different from the end
    of the path, we get a big sweeping turn. this feature uses
    the previous orientation to avoid that sweeping turn and
    instead does a final in-place rotation. Add filter and pose
    publisher.

  * unitialized limits causes test failures (#14 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/14>)
    limits does not initialize prune_plan to a value,
    causes flaky test when it ends up true (would also
    probably be bad on a real robot)
