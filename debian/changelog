ros-melodic-graceful-controller-ros (0.4.1-1bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * add ability to disable orientation filtering (#26 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/26>)
    also make everything dynamic reconfigurable
  * don't crash when path is empty (#25 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/25>)
  * add min_lookahead parameter (#24 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/24>)
    when the pose is very close to the robot, we can get
    some instability (rapid side-to-side movement due to
    large angular errors over small linear distances). by
    adding this parameter, we can instead fallback to
    recovery behaviors and find a better path.
  * fix occasional boost::lock crash (#23 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/23>)
  * limit the distance between poses as filter runs (#21 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/21>)
  * improve the orientation filter, add tests (#20 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/20>)

ros-melodic-graceful-controller-ros (0.4.0-1bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * add usage documentation (#19 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/19>)
    also remove unused min_vel_theta parameter
  * implement changes from review (#18 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/18>)
    * Add collision checking during final rotation
    * Add comments about getRobotVel returning velocities
    * Rename path to simulated_path for clarity
    * Rename pose to target_pose and goal_pose (now separate variables)
    * Get rid of magic number for when to use final rotation
  * simulate intial rotation properly (#17 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/17>)
    previously, this simulated the big arc that we wouldn't follow anyways.
    this could cause the robot to get stuck in corners or other tight areas.

ros-melodic-graceful-controller-ros (0.3.1-1bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * add feature for final rotation (#15 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/15>)
    if the final pose orientation is very different from the end
    of the path, we get a big sweeping turn. this feature uses
    the previous orientation to avoid that sweeping turn and
    instead does a final in-place rotation. Add filter and pose
    publisher.
  * not sure how build is working without this being executable

ros-melodic-graceful-controller-ros (0.3.0-1bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * unitialized limits causes test failures (#14 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/graceful_controller/issues/14>)
    limits does not initialize prune_plan to a value,
    causes flaky test when it ends up true (would also
    probably be bad on a real robot)
